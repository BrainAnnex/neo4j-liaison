#### As of Dec. 2021, "neo4j-liaison" has been superseded by an expanded library named ["NeoAccess"](https://github.com/BrainAnnex/neoaccess).  Later, the "NeoAccess" library was in turn absorbed into the parent project [BrainAnnex](https://github.com/BrainAnnex/brain-annex), and renamed "GraphAccess".
